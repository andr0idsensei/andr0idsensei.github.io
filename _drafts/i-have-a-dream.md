Indeed, why? Isn't freedom and financial independence more desirable to the daily grind? Wouldn't you prefer spending time with your family and doing something you love instead of menial, boring or repeating and un-creative work every day for at least 8 hours? For the lucky few who's jobs intersect with their passion, this would be reality, but for most people things aren't all that nice.

So then, why do we tend to be fearful of a future where machines can do almost any kind of work? I think that this fear is deeply rooted in the way we currently structure our society based on economic rules. The paradox of having a machine that doesn't need to eat, sleep or raise a family do our work while we're out of our jobs not being able to eat, sleep or raise a family is what scares us.
