Recently I've been reading more and more articles about the advancements in Artificial Intelligence that seem to pop up every week and I have stumbled upon a very interesting article in 2 parts written by Tim Urban of Wait But Why. This, as most of the articles on Wait But Why ia a very well written, researched and detailed piece of work which describes very well the types of AI as well as pointing out some very important aspects of it's development. It discusses why there are some high profile people such as Elon Musk or Stephen Hawking so worried about the development of general AI, and it left me with a sense of importance about this subject which got me thinking about it more and more each day. Practically, AI would be the most important think humans ever invented, since it has the potential to radically change the world as we know it. And by radically, I mean beyond our wildest imagination can possibly imagine. However, it also has the potential to obliterate humanity and that is a rather gloomy prospect for us. Heaven or Hell, this kind of technology can go either way, so we need to be careful of how we develop it. Also all of us should be aware of what AI means for humanity and make sure that when the ones developing this kind of technology go down the wrong path, we warn them.
I really encourage you to read the afore mentioned articles in order to better understand what AI is and what it can really mean for us. I promise there's no complex math or code in them :)
