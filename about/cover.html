		Hello Basecamp!
	</h6>
	<p>
		My name is Mihai and I would like to tell you a short story about myself, so grab your coffe or tea and please bear with me. When I was in highscool, my mother wanted me to become an M.D. and she insisted I prepared for Medical School. I think that was because, in communist Romania, doctors used to make a good living and had high social status; nevertheless, being a doctor didn't really resonate with me.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		It was also around that time that I made my first contact with computers. This was the '90s post-communist Romania and computers were just beginning to make their presence felt, so first I started off with some crappy no-name game consoles. But since I liked it so much that I would play games and have sleepovers at friends who had PC's, I decided to ask my father to buy me my own PC - even though I knew it would be a great financial effort for our family at that time. To my surprise, he sold an arm and a leg and got me an Intel Pentium 166Mhz processor PC. And what joyous times followed! I played games like Doom 2, Tomb Raider, Starcraft and Diablo, played with Corel Draw and Rebirth RB-338, hacked game saves to get myself infinite ammo and lives.
		My father used to tell my mom that I'm so absorbed with that computer, I'm never going to be a doctor.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		Meanwhile, I continued to prepare for Medical School, but my passion for computers grew and I kept thinking about Computer Science as a University option. So, when I failed my admission exams into Medical School, I mustered all the courage I could get, went back home to my mom and told her that I'm through with medicine, and I would like to prepare for Computer Science instead. It was one of the hardest decisions I had to make, but looking back, it was also one of the best.

		So why do I consider this relevant for a cover letter? I guess it's because this story best illustrates how passionate I am about programming and how I follow this passion as a compass to guide me in whatever I set out to do. It was this same drive I had when Android came about and I thought that this is something with potential; so I set out to learn how to make apps and then found myself doing this professionally. I started with <a href="https://code.google.com/p/aegis-shield/">Aegis Shield</a> in order to learn Android, then I made <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blogspot.hypersynapse.sa">Shopping Assistant</a>, which also is a learning experiment that I published on Google Play to see how that goes. Unfortunately, it didn't make me a millionaire :), so eventually I went on and got some jobs as an Android Engineer, which I am currently am doing for a living. Some of the apps I worked on professionally are <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kno.textbooks&hl=en">Kno Textbooks</a> and <a href="http://www.tolino.de/de/produkte/tolino-tab-8/">Tolino Tab</a>.

		Why do I think I'd be a good fit at Basecamp? Looking at your history, I can say you're no average software company. From Ruby on Rails to Basecamp the product, from 37signals to Basecamp the company, being on the avantgarde of remote working, your ideas are pioneering and inspiring. I like to say about myself that I'm not an average software engineer because I always like to be on the tide of new technology. People that know me, tell me that I have the ability to inspire others. I say indeed, however there's a catch. In order to be able to inspire, I have to be inspired myself and Basecamp certainly seems to have that ability.
