		Wellcome, this is my short bio.
	</h6>

	<p>
		My name is Mihai and I would like to tell you a short story about myself, so grab your coffe or tea and please bear with me. When I was in highscool, my mother wanted me to become an M.D. and she insisted I prepared for Medical School. I think that was because, in communist Romania, doctors used to make a good living and had high social status; nevertheless, being a doctor didn't really resonate with me.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		It was also around that time that I made my first contact with computers. This was the '90s post-communist Romania and computers were just beginning to make their presence felt, so first I started off with some crappy no-name game consoles. But since I liked it so much that I would play games and have sleepovers at friends who had PC's, I decided to ask my father to buy me my own PC - even though I knew it would be a great financial effort for our family at that time. To my surprise, he sold an arm and a leg and got me an Intel Pentium 166Mhz processor PC. And what joyous times followed! I played games like Doom 2, Tomb Raider, Starcraft and Diablo, played with Corel Draw and Rebirth RB-338, hacked game saves to get myself infinite ammo and lives.
		My father used to tell my mom that I'm so absorbed with that computer, I'm never going to be a doctor.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		Meanwhile, I continued to prepare for Medical School, but my passion for computers grew and I kept thinking about Computer Science as a University option. So, when I failed my admission exams into Medical School, I mustered all the courage I could get, went back home to my mom and told her that I'm through with medicine, and I would like to prepare for Computer Science instead. It was one of the hardest decisions I had to make, but looking back, it was also one of the best.

		Why would I tell you this? Well I guess that this story best illustrates how passionate I am about programming and how I follow this passion as a compass to guide me in whatever I set out to do. It was this same drive I had when Android came about and I thought that this is something with potential; so I set out to learn how to make apps and then found myself doing this professionally. I started with <a href="https://code.google.com/p/aegis-shield/">Aegis Shield</a> in order to learn Android, then I made <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blogspot.hypersynapse.sa">Shopping Assistant</a>, which also is a learning experiment that I published on Google Play to see how that goes. Unfortunately, it didn't make me a millionaire :), so eventually I went on and got some jobs as an Android Engineer, which I am currently am doing for a living. Some of the apps I worked on professionally are <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kno.textbooks&hl=en">Kno Textbooks</a> and <a href="http://www.tolino.de/de/produkte/tolino-tab-8/">Tolino Tab</a>.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		But the story isn't over yet. Since usually there's about a hundred ideas running around in my head and there are sooooo many things I would like to learn and try in this lifetime, you'll never know what I'm going to do next. Hell, I don't even know that sometimes :). However, I surely enjoy sharing the things I learn, so if you want to know how the story progresses and perhaps (if I do a good job) learn something new along the way, keep checking <a href="http://www.androidsensei.com"> androidsensei.com </a>.
