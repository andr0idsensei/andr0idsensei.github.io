Recently I've watched [Guillermo del Toro's] [del_toro] [Pacific Rim] [pacific_rim] and because I find mind controlled giant robots really fascinating and I did see some impressive real life examples where controlling technology with your mind can make a difference - which also pushed my geeky buttons - I thought about writing a piece in which to make a parallel between Sci Fi and reality on this subject.
<br/><br/>
The idea behind Pacific Rim's mech control system isn't really new. If you are the least bit familiar with [Jpanese Anime] [anime] movies, surely there would be some examples that would come to mind. The one that came to my mind when I watched Pacific Rim was [Neon Genesis Evangelion] [evangelion], an anime series directed by [Hideaki Anno] [anno] in which *the main story centers around Shinji, a teenage boy who is recruited by the shadowy organization NERV to pilot a giant bio-machine called an Evangelion in combat against monstrous beings known as Angels* (see more in the [Wikipedia description] [evangelion_wiki]). If you haven't already seen Evangelion, I would recommend you check it out. Any self respecting geek should see it :).
<br/><br/>
The Pacific Rim novelty for me was the idea of *The Drift* - a way to pilot the *Jaeger* bots in which two pilots would share the load of controlling the huge machines by each using half of their brain. This made the whole process of piloting the [Jaegers] [jaeger] in order to fight the *strange beasts* called [Kaiju] [kaiju] very difficult since the two pilots had to share a special connection in order to be able to *drift* with each other.
<br><br/>
Well, it turns out that in this case such Sci Fi movie ideas inspired some of our best and brightest scientists to work on real life technology that can be used to control various real life items with your mind. For starters, an interesting example would be [Emotiv's] [emotiv_wiki] [Epoc] [epoc] EEG controller. This little piece of hardware can be placed on it's user's head and by scanning her brainwaves, can be used to control characters in a video game, for example. However, this is not the only application for which the Epoc can be used. I've seen some clips of people controlling their [Lego Mindstorms NXT] [nxt] robot creations with it, and it doesn't stop at that. A very interesting application that I've seen Epoc used for is the Mindtunes campaign. You can watch this cool documentary clip in which musicians and DJ's who suffered physically disabling events in their lives, were again able to create music and DJ again by using Epoc.
