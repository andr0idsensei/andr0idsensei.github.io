>Hell, it's about time!

I have been on a long sabatical from writing articles on my [blog] [hypersynapse] and lately I've been thinking that it's time I start writing again about what I've been up to. During this long absence period I've started working [Android] [android] development professionally - namely I'm earning my keep doing this as a job. I've also became a father and a lot of things changed in my personal life.
<br><br>
Since I'm passionate about Android and not only, I thought that it only natural to try and share some of the wisdom I gained and pains I've been trhough while learning and working with Android. However, I do not want to make this blog specifically about that, hence the title of the first post - *A blog about Android, Life, the Universe and Everything* - should give you an idea about the topics I want to cover here :). You might argue that we already know the answer to life, the universe and everything, *and that is 42*, but I say that it's worth documenting how we got to that answer :).
<br><br>
In case you're asking why I started a new blog and did not continue writing on Blogspot, the answer is that I wanted to be able to better customize the look and feel of my blog and perhaps in the future migrate to a full fledged site. I felt that I could not do that very well on Blogspot because it didn't offer me the freedom I wanted to meddle with the code as well as having a content management system that would be easy to use. 
<br><br>
While looking around for an alternative, I first stopped on Wordpress since it is a widely used platform and has a lot of themes available for free, as well as payed. I proceded to download Wordpress and learn about the platform but one day I read an article on [Squirrel Park] [sqpark], [Opoloo's] [opoloo] blog, which mentioned [Jekyll][jekyll] as static site generation platform which was used by [GitHub][github] to manage their web pages. I quickly checked out Jekyll and I realized that it was just what I wanted because it seemed simple to set up and create a site with it. Moreover, GitHub offers free hosting and inherently supports Jekyll sites, so that was a big bonus since it helped me quickly and painlessly solve my hosting problem. Did I mention it was free?
<br><br>
So, I got busy searching for themes and learning more about Jekyll and I ended up picking the [Redcup][redcup] theme which I customized into what you currently see here as version 1.0 of my new blog (updates will follow). I quickly discovered that you can use [Disqus][disqus] or other commenting platforms to integrate them with Jekyll and I've integrated [Addthis] for the social sharing and following options. By the way, you can visit my [about][about] page and give me a ping on one of the social networks listed there.
<br><br>
Perhaps in future posts, I'll enter into specific details about working with Jekyll. If you're interested on that, let me know in the comments below.
This being said, I'm looking forward to writing more stuff and hearing from you in the comments or on the social networks :).
