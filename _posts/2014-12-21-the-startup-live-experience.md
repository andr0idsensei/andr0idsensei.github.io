Being a curious programmer, inclination towards tinkering and experimenting with technology comes naturally to me. As such, when I occasionally start side projects which allow me to do my experimentation. Lately, however, I felt the need to do more than just technical tinkering and started to flirt with the idea of entrepreneurship so I began participating at local startup events in order to gain more insight into that. At first, the startup scene here in Cluj wasn't all that lively, there were a few events like [How to Web] [how_to_web] and [Startup Weekend] [startup_weekend], but in the last one and a half years things started to heat up and currently we are witnessing quite some interest in this area with more entrepreneurship events and also with the rise of interest from investors and accelerators.
First 2 events I participated were [Startup Weekends] [startup_weekend] which have an interesting format but seem more focused on having a prototype ready by the end of the weekend event.
