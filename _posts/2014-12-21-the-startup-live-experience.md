Being a curious programmer, inclination towards tinkering and experimenting with technology comes naturally to me. As such, I occasionally start side projects which allow me to do my experimentation. Lately, however, I felt the need to do more than just technical tinkering and started to flirt with the idea of entrepreneurship, so, I begun participating at local startup events in order to gain more insight into that. At first, the startup scene here in Cluj wasn't all that lively. There were a few events like [How to Web] [how_to_web] and [Startup Weekend] [startup_weekend], but in the last one and a half year things started to heat up and currently we are witnessing quite some interest in this area. The startup community seems to be more cohesive even more  events are starting to be organized as well as potential investors are sarting to take notice of this community. One such event was the latest edition of [Startup Live] [startup_live], which turned out to be an interesting experience for me. Here's the full story:
<br/><br/>

First 2 events I participated were [Startup Weekends] [startup_weekend] which have an interesting format but seem more focused on having a prototype ready by the end of the weekend event. Also since I am not a very big fan of public speaking I was a bit afraid to step up and pitch some ideas, so my participation resumed to hacking away at the prototypes for the ideas I voted up. This all made for a nice experience but coding is what I do for a living, so it wasn't very hard to hack together some MVP's in a weekend. In other words, not much of a challenge :).
This time around I decided to get out of my comfort zone and make the step towards pitching an idea. Besides that, I wanted to do something different then hacking a prototype in a weekend, I wanted a chance to talk to the mentors which participated and pick their brains on all things entreprenurial. I wanted, for example, some insight on how to deal with a full time job in order to make a living while trying to be an entrepreneur. I wanted to see, in the given short time, how to prepare for a pitch presentation and what you need to do in order to convince investors that your idea is worth it. I wanted to get a clue on what investors look at and how they think.

<br/><br/>
Well I'm happy to say that I got all this and even more. Even if the idea I pitched wasn't voted further, I joined another cool idea to form a team and I was pleasently surprised to find out that the [Startup Live] [startup_live] event wasn't focused on the prototype but on trying to validate an idea in a lean manner before starting to code a prototype. So, I had a first encounter with the idea of Lean Launch Pad for which I found after the event that there is a free course on [Udacity] [udacity_lean_startup]. I'll be sure to get into more depth on this since I think it's a good point to try and validate your ideas with as less coding investment as possible.
Then, together with my newly formed team, I got out of my comfort zone even more by going out on the street and talking to people about our idea to try and get some feedback if we have a potentially good thing going for us. Even though there were quite many people who didn't stop to talk to us - a thing which we expected - I was pleasently surprised to find out that the ones who did stop, were giving us positive feedback, wich was encouraging. Also, we created an online survey since after going out on the field we refined our questions and we got quite some good answers from that too.
