> Happy Women's Day!
>
>

This is a short dedication to all women on this special day. Thank you for being you, thank you for loving and accepting us men even when we're not the most sensitive and appreciative of you. And as an appreciation from me, here is a special song which I believe is a testament to the strenght of all women everywhere.

It is called "Night Witches", written by the Swedish metal band Sabaton and it is dedicated to the women of the 588th Night Bomber Regiment of the Soviet Air Forces who flew a series of harrassment and precision bombing missions against German military during World War II. The regiment consisted entirely of women and they were using Polikarpov Po-2 biplanes which were actually indended for crop-dusting but since they were faster than german planes they were very hard to shoot down.

They got their infamous nickname - Nachthexen (Night Witches) because they used to employ a stealth technique which would imply idling their engines and gliding to their targets at night with only wind noise to reveal their positions. The german soldiers thought the sound similar to broomsticks and named the pilots "Nachthexen".
